# Simplified Profile Settings Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the simplified implementation of the Profile Settings feature for the Ward Cleaning App. This version doesn't require external authentication or state management libraries, making it easier to run and test without dependencies.

## Why a Simplified Version?

The original implementation required several external dependencies:
- `@clerk/nextjs` for authentication
- `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching
- `@radix-ui/react-dialog` and other UI components

To avoid dependency issues, we've created a simplified version that:
1. Uses mock data instead of real API calls
2. Eliminates external dependencies
3. Focuses on the core UI and user experience

## How to Access the Simplified Version

The simplified version is available at:
```
/settings-new
```

While the original version (which may require dependencies) is at:
```
/app/settings
```

## Component Structure

1. `app/settings-new/page.tsx` - The main settings page with tabbed navigation
2. `app/settings-new/profile-form.tsx` - The profile form component

## Features Implemented

The simplified version includes:
- Profile information editing (first name, last name, username, bio)
- Read-only email field
- Phone number field with simulated verification alerts
- Avatar management with simulated controls
- Role selection for admin users
- Form validation and dirty state tracking
- Simulated save functionality

## Mock Data

The implementation uses the following mock user data:
```javascript
const userData = {
  id: "user_123",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  username: "johndoe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  phone_number: "(555) 123-4567",
  is_phone_verified: true,
  avatar_url: "/images/avatars/default.png",
  bio: "I'm a dedicated volunteer who loves helping with our building maintenance. I specialize in floor care and window cleaning.",
  role: "admin"
};
```

## Key Differences from Full Implementation

1. **API Calls**: Instead of real API calls, we use `setTimeout` and `alert` to simulate server interactions.
2. **Avatar Selection**: Instead of a modal dialog, we use a simple alert.
3. **Phone Verification**: Instead of a multi-step verification flow, we use an alert message.
4. **UI Components**: We use native HTML elements instead of Radix UI components.
5. **Authentication**: We don't require Clerk authentication.

## Future Migration Path

When you're ready to implement the full version with all dependencies:

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs @tanstack/react-query @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-tabs class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react
```

2. Create the UI component helpers:
   - `components/ui/dialog.tsx`
   - `components/ui/button.tsx`
   - `components/ui/input.tsx`
   - `components/ui/label.tsx`
   - `components/ui/tabs.tsx`

3. Implement the full versions of the avatar selector and phone verification components.

4. Update the API routes to work with your authentication and database solution.

## Accessibility and Responsiveness

Even in this simplified version, we've maintained:
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- Clear form labels and instructions
- Visual indicators for form state
